# advanced-Flow-scheduler

Code base for flow scheduling with queuing.

When using the code, please cite the following paper:

## Build

### Requirements

- cmake (3.24 or later)
- C++20 compiler (tested with GCC 13.1.0)
- git
- python 3.9 (or later)

### How to Build

clone the repository and open a shell inside.

```
mkdir build 
cd build
cmake ..
make -j6
```

Now there should be a file called _AdvancedFlowSchedulerExec_.

#### Unit Tests

The unit tests are build by default.
If you do not want to build them, add `-DBUILD_TESTS=0` to the cmake command.

To run the tests, run the executable _unit_tests_ in the test directory.
Run this executable only from within the test directory since otherwise the file paths won't work.

## How to create input Data

You can find some python scripts in the _support_tools_ directory.
To create network graphs, use the `create_network.py` script.
Note: the `create_network.py` script is not very well documented yet. Depending on the graph generator (-g) selected, the other arguments (-s, -d, -e) have different meanings. Check the script itself for details.

When the network graph file is created, it can be visualized with the `draw_graph.py` script.

To create an evaluation scenario, you need a graph file and have to create/modify an ini (default _create_scenario.ini_) file.
Quick config: keep `equal_traffic = 0` and the `cluster_sizes_ = [1]`. The remaining options should be self-explanatory.

Then run the `create_scenario.py` script (pass the ini file as argument).

## How to run the Scheduler

```
./AdvancedFlowSchedulerExec -n "network file path" -s "scenario file path" -a h2s -f 4 -c 1
```

### Command line parameters

| command line option      | description                                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -n, --network            | TEXT REQUIRED  File path to the network graph as edge list                                                                   |
| -s, --scenario           | TEXT REQUIRED File path to the scenario as json                                                                              |
| -r, --print-raw          | if set, the results will be printed non pretty for machine parsing                                                           |
| -o, --offensive-planning | if set, the offensive planning will be executed when defensive can not schedule all flows. EDF requires this flag to be set. |

The scheduling and routing can be specified with the following options and arguments.

### Scheduling algorithms [-a, --algorithm]

## Extending the code

The code is structured in a way that it should be easy to extend it with new scheduling algorithms, routing algorithms, or rating functions.
Each building block has an interface that needs to implemented and a factory where the new implementation needs to be registered.
